Router -> paths a user takes that are attached to code that will be triggered when 
a user reaches specific route
Dispatcher -> Decides which controller should handle request from a route

API -> Application Programming Interface
Published set of rules for a particular set of software works
Ex. Ruby object API is public methods
For a Rails app/website, API would be routes. Ex. GET /cats

Web Service vs Web Site
Web Site -> get back HTML, CSS, JS, images, and rendered
Web Service/API -> get back raw data like JSON

Can split up application into multiple web services
Mobile App, server <-> server communication, client side rendering

Client -> HTTP request to server
Server -> HTTP response to client

Request has a method(GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, etc), a path, query string, 
body (usually key-value pairs. Can't have in GET requests)

Response -> status(what happened, usually a number + code), body

HTTP Request -> Rails Router(path, method) -> Create Controller and call action

routes.rb file -> list of routes to check
DSL to determine routes!
name of HTTP method -> path -> controller#controller_method

REST -> to specify routes! 
get table_name -> index -> get all 
get table_name/:id -> show -> show one
post table_name -> create 
patch table_name/:id -> update 
put table_name/:id -> update 
delete table_name/:id -> destroy

resources table_name, only: [method_names] -> Can make like this if you don't 
use ad-hoc routes

Nested? Ex. 
resources :table_name do 
  resources :another_table_name, only [:method_names] usually :index
end

Nest collection routes, but not other routes! Think about why this is. -> 
You only need ID to do the rest!

Ex. get 'silly', to: 'silly#fun' -> get request to silly path to controller silly 
using fun method

To make a controller, have it be the same name as table with _controller after!
https://gist.github.com/iangreenleaf/b206d09c587e8fc6399e#file-gistfile1-md
Rails naming conventions ^^^
Even singular routes match to a plural controller by default!
Inherit from ApplicationController to make a controller!

params -> hash-like object given from router to controller, has 
1) query string 
2) request body 
3) URL params/route params (wildcards)
params[:whatever] to access...
?message=hi&fun=potato in query string
send k/v during request
:id -> wildcard

index : .all 
show : .find_by(id: params[:id])
create : .new(class_name_params), .save
update : .find_by, .update(class_name_params)
destroy : .find_by, .destroy
.errors.full_messages -> print out said messages on failed instance
class_name_params : params.require(class_name).permit(attributes)
think  params[:class_name] has these [attributes]
REQUIRE top level key of :class_name then put in attributes under said class name

bundle exec rails routes -> see all routes

Rails router recognizes URLs and chooses a controller method to which the 
request is dispatched for processing.

GET /photos index -> list of all photos 
GET /photos/new new -> HTML Form for new photo 
POST /photos create -> upload and create a new photo 
GET photos/:id show -> display a specific photo 
GET /photos/:id/edit -> HTML Form for editing a photo 
PATCH or PUT /photos/:id -> update a specific photo 
DELETE /photos/:id -> delete a specific photo
New/Edit are just forms!

REST Philosophy -> even more complicated actions thought in terms of CRUD
URLs refer to either collections of resources or single instances of resources
Diff HTTP methods = diff actions you can do to collection/instance

Specifying resource -> create routing helper methods -> 
photos_url, new_photo_url, photo_url(@photo), edit_photo_url(@photo)
The plural and the singular simply makes sense. -> Remember that regardless 
in the link, photos is always used.
Do not write URLs by hand in Rails...

4 URLs -> 7 actions
Most methods that take a URL will also accept a :method option

Ex. of embedding query-string option into url-helper
photos_url(recent: true) == http://www.example-site.com/photos?recent=true

Don't use _path, be consistent and just use _url all the time.
Ex. path will give /photos while url will give http://www.example-site.com/photos
Can tack _url to the route name to get the routing helper!

No create_user URL name -> create corresponds to a POST request on /users, which 
utilizes users_url

Specify controller action that Rails should run for GET / by using the root 
method. Ex. root to: 'posts#index' means that this invokes PostsController's index 
method when root URL is requested

Controllers are doers -> ask model to fetch data, process user input to 
save new data, build/send a response, redirect user, etc

Pluralize name of method and tack on controller
Usually only create/update has a request body due to forms

Setting instance variables in controller does not affect processing of 
future requests -> controller instance is discarded after every request! 
State is saved in database(server-side) or cookie(client-side)

Callbacks -> methods that get called at certain moments of an object's life 
cycle -> write code to run whenever an active record object is created/saved/updated/
deleted/validated/loaded

Ex. dependent: :destroy/:nullify/:restrict, usually used on a has_many
Very rarely added to belongs_to

To guarantee "referential integrity", enforce constraint at DB level.
FOREIGN KEY constraint!

Callback registration -> can hook into other model lifecycle events
Impelment callbacks as ordinary methods then use a macro-style class method to 
register them as callbacks 
Ie. 
protected or private
def ensure_random_code then at top: before_validation :ensure_random_code

Most common ActiveRecord callbacks: before_validation, after_create, after_destroy
Can also specific on certain operations, ie. before_validation(on: :create)

Delegation -> create getters so Law of Demeter isn't violated
In associations, can use delegate in this way as well!
can delegate :number, :address, to: :office, prefix: true
This will delegate office's number/address methods to the current class, and add 
a prefix
So you can call doctor_instance.office_number, doctor_instance.office_address
Then can further delegate these created methods too! They're just a shortcut.
Essentially in code, they'd be very simple to create! 
Just do def office_number then call office.number.

DNS -> domain name system -> naming system that translates domain names to IP 
addresses 
Domain name consists of 1+ labels typically separated by dots, ie. www.example.com 
has 3 labels. Labels ordered from right to left

No one central DB of domain names/IP addresses -> set of authoritative name 
servers for each domain that delegate authority for a subdomain to another 
name server. Counterparts of name servers(holders of info) are DNS resolvers
(lookers-up of info), every OS has a DNS resolver built-in as well as 
all ISPs. Do not only query for IP addresses, but also cache recent/popular 
results.

Query journey
DNS resolver -> DNS name server -> deliver directly if cached, else -> can either 
change roles from holder to looker-up(recursive case) or return its best guess
of what other nme server has appropriate info(iterative case) 

Common DNS attack -> cache poisoning -> replaces valid cache entries w/ 
corrupted data aka IP address of a diff site

Domain name registration -> purchase rights to domain name thru domain name 
registrar -> claim ownership of said domain name  -> change records stored 
by name servers to decide what IP address said domain should point to

Postman ->test route and controller actions
4 main components
1. request type - change dropdown to send GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE requests 
2. request URL - change path to which request is made 
3. body tab - input the body/data of requeest, K-V pairs in form-data sub-tab 
4. Response - see response body and HTTP status
Optionally, can build query string by clicking Params to right of 
Request URL/add k-v pairs

To make request out of localhost:3000, have to turn off CSRF protection 
until it's implemented. Comment out "protect from forgery" in application_controller.rb 
5. Hit send to make request and inspect response

Do not test any routes that redirect with Postman -> it keeps the same request 
type through redirects incorrectly

JSON -> typically better for non-browser clients. You can use your own API!

#to_json produces JSON string -> works on collections and individual objects
render json: etc -> automatically calls #to_json under the hood

Collection routes -> index, new, create
Member routes -> show, edit, update, update, destroy
Never generate any member routes when nesting! 
:only :except options for building routes!

Nested index routes! -> Yes.
NO nested create routes -> Superfluous! Hidden field to upload the id.
Nested new is okay -> Ex. magazines/123/articles/new should still post to /articles

To add another member route, simply put 
resources :photos do
  member do 
    get 'preview'
  end 
Would be a GET request for photos/1/preview
For collections, change member to collection.

Try to stick with RESTful routes, though.

status: :unprocessable_entity, etc, learn status messages!
inclusion validation!
Never nest things 2 levels deep...

rendering html or html.erb intead of json!

erb -> embedded ruby
<%= %> Can put Ruby code in there that's shown!
<% %>  Ruby code not shown
Instance variables in controller -> accessible in view
Best to do logic in controller, view only presents information
render :show -> show.html.erb
Helper method: Ex. cats_url, cat_url(:id), etc

Forms! Ex. 
new -> /cats/new 
edit -> /cats/:id/edit

Ex.
<form action="/cats" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="cat[name]"> Means to nest data in cat
  <input type="submit" value="Create Cat"
</form>

1. GET cats/new to fetch orm 
2. User fills out form, clciks submit 
3. POST /cats the data in the form 
4. Create action is invoked, cat is created
5. Send client a redirect to /cat/:id 
6. Client amkes a get request for /cats/:id 
7. Show action for newly created cat is invoked

When you do something like render :show, you can't calling the show method, but 
simply rendering the show template.
Meaning instead of rendering, should redirect! 
redirect_to -> contains another URL, method is called!

Forms can only make GET or POST requests! To make other requests like delete, 
you'd have to 
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE"

When you just render instead of redirect, you keep all the old information! 
No need for people to fill out information again.

Add a value, Etc. 
value="<%=@cat.name%> -> Blank so nil, when render again, what was filled out 
will stay filled out even after incorrect submit.

Each HTTP request is stateless! 
Can't redirect or render, can't do both!

in select, option, value="whatever", if etc == etc, selected
This allows default even in select dropdown lists!
Iterate through a list that's initialized in controllers to make things easier--
write more Ruby less HTML.

Form partials 
--------------
#persisted? -> Saved to database or not
action_url = ?? cat_url(@cat) if persisted, else cats_url
method = ?? "PATCH" if persisted, else "POST"
submit_text = ?? "UPDATED" if persisted, else "CREATED"

Partials always start with an underscore _, live in same directory as views. 
render :form to render _form.html.erb
When rendering a partial, send in instance variable and give another name. Ex. 
<%= render "form", cat: @cat %> Then inside the partial, can just call cat
So you use things within scope, less error-prone.

How rack encodes and parses forms! -> Creates nested structures 

Intersectionality, how you describe something changes it completely, levels of 
female harassment in tech, why diversity is needed in product design (think 
testing car seat belt tests for men/women, computer vision failing to recognize 
certain races as people, etc)

Learning Goals:
Be able to create routes in routes.rb
Be able to read/understand Rails server error messages 
Know the 3 places that params come from 
Be able to nesty query parameters 
Be ablet o write controller actions that read/write to the database 
Know how and when to render errors

In config/application.rb
config.action_controller.default_protect_from_forgery = false
For now...

Each route -> API endpoint which encapsulates a single action your app can take

Rails server -> creatse instance of Router that holds instances of Routes defined 
by routes.rb -> request comes in and Router matches a route based on HTTP method 
and url path with REGEX -> fist matched route instantiates an instance of 
controller and calls action

Each API endpoint CRUDs a resource

Put helper methods in ApplicationController to share across all controllers

rails server! (loads in development mode)
Listening to quests at http://0.0.0.0:3000, aka

Always be looking at the server log!

In the absence of an explicit render, controller will by default try to 
render a template w/ same name as controller action. 
Ie. for index, index.html.erb 

render text: is depreciated, used plain: instead

params 
------
Route parameters (e.g. the :id from /users/:id)
Query string (the part of the URL after the ?: ?key=value)
POST/PATCH request data (the body of the HTTP request).

params also consists of the controller and the action as well

Nested parameters -> [][][] etc. Just keep nesting dat dict.

Nest under an inner hash to use mass assignment!

Default status code: 200 (OK)
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#the-status-option

After destroying in DB, you can still render the object you have.
Always render or redirect! 

Usage of update_attributes over update
Returns false if save failed! Rather than update that just returns the object 
no matter what

Learning Goals
Be able to write Active Record models quickly
Know how to write a user_params method
Be able to write the five API RESTful controller methods
Know how to test your API endpoints with Postman
Know how to create and destroy join table records via controller methods
Know how a nested route works

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6169996/index-on-multiple-columns-in-ruby-on-rails
For multiple column indexes, index the one that narrows the rows more first.

#find_by only returns the first
Use #where if you wish to have an array/collection returned

#uniq method works just fine for Active Record objects

Can setup multiple routes to same controller action! Then take action depending 
on what the params are...

Remember that in real world development, most things won't be implemented on your 
own but aided by libraries. Like, you wouldn't be doing authentication yourself.

Hmm.. I guess you could put anything after the ? then check for it.
Ex. ?query=Te
Remember "%" wildcard matcher in SQL.

Polymorphic Association -> a model can belong to more than one other model, 
on a single association.
Ie. a polymorphic belongs_to declaration sets up an interface that any other model 
can use.
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations

PUT VS PATCH 
Put remakes the item completely, patch updates it.

It's important to dependent: :destroy, think about it once most things are setup.

So far the process seems like 
1. Start a new rails project, add in useful gems
2. Setup database through migrations, seeding, etc. Making sure to index/constraint 
3. Setup models, making sure to validate/make associations
4. Setup server
5. Setup routes, nested and non-RESTful as well
6. Setup controllers, CRUD -> new/edit
